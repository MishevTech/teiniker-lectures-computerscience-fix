# Data Types in C

Arithmetic operations in digital systems with **limited range and precision** do not always produce 
the same result as they would in ordinary methematics.

The types in C can be classified as follows:

* [**Boolean**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/c-basics/types-operators-expressions/types/boolean)\
    Since C99, we have the macros **bool**, **true** and **false**, which stand for 1 and 0, and can be used for Boolean variables.

* [**Integer Numbers**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/c-basics/types-operators-expressions/types/integer)\
    Each integer type represents a finite range of integer numbers. 
    * **Unsigned integer types** represent values that can be only zero or positive.
    * **Signed integer types** represent values that can ne negative, zero, or positive.
   
* [**Floating-Point Numbers**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/c-basics/types-operators-expressions/types/floating-point)\
    Floating-point is the most common representation for real numbers in computers.

* [**Characters**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/c-basics/types-operators-expressions/types/character)\
    Character data include alphabethic symbols, punctuation marks, numeric digits, spaces, tabs, and so on.
