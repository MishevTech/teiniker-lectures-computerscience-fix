# First Steps: From C to C++ 

With the use of a C++ compiler, some new features can be used even without object-oriented programming.

* [Namespaces](namespaces/)
    Namespaces in C++ are used to organize code into **logical groups** and prevent name 
    conflicts in large projects by providing a **distinct scope for identifiers** such as 
    variables, functions, and classes.

* [auto Initialization](auto-initialization/)
    Auto-initialization in C++ allows for the **automatic deduction of the type of a variable** 
    from its initializer, simplifying code and improving readability.


Many of these language extensions incur **little to no overhead compared to C code**
and can therefore also be used in embedded systems.
