# First Steps: From C to C++ 

With the use of a C++ compiler, some new features can be used even without object-oriented programming.

* [Namespaces](namespaces/)
* [Implicit typedef of struct, union, and enum](implicit-typedef/)
* [auto Initialization](auto-initialization/)
* [Function Overloading ](function-overloading/)
* [Default Arguments](default-arguments/)
* [References](references/)

Many of these language extensions incur **little to no overhead compared to C code**
and can therefore also be used in embedded systems.
