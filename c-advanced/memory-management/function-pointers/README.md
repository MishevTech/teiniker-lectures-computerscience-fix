# Function Pointers

We have seen that pointers may point to various kinds of data, including variables, array elements, 
and dynamic allocated blocks of memory.

But C does not require that pointers point only to data, it is also possible to have pointers to functions.
Functions occupy memory locations, so every function has an address, just as each variable has an address.


## Function Pointers as Argument 


```C
    int *i_ptr;     // Pointer declaration
```

## The qsort() Function


## Function Pointers in Structures
