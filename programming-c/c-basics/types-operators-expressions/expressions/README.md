# Expressions

The simplest expressions are variables and constants.
A **variable** represents a value to be computed as the program runs. 
A **constant** represents a value that doesn't change.

More complicated expressions apply **operators** to operands (which are themselves expressions).
Operators are the basic tool for building expressions, and C has a rich collection of them.
