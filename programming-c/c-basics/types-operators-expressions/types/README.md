# Data Types in C

Arithmetic operations in digital systems with **limited range and precision** do not always produce 
the same result as they would in ordinary mathematics.

The types in C can be classified as follows:

* [**Boolean**](boolean)\
    Since C99, we have the macros **bool**, **true** and **false**, which stand for 1 and 0, and can be used for Boolean variables.

* [**Integer Numbers**](integer)\
    Each integer type represents a finite range of integer numbers. 
    * **Unsigned integer types** represent values that can be only zero or positive.
    * **Signed integer types** represent values that can ne negative, zero, or positive.
   
* [**Floating-Point Numbers**](floating-point)\
    Floating-point is the most common representation for real numbers in computers.

* [**Characters**](characters)\
    Character data include alphabethic symbols, punctuation marks, numeric digits, spaces, tabs, and so on.

* [**Strings**](strings)\
    C uses character arrays to store strings.
