# Complex Numbers 

Complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers and provide solutions to certain 
equations that have no solutions in the real numbers. 
A complex number is expressed in the form: `a+bi`, where:
* `a` is the real part,
* `b` is the imaginary part,
* `i` is the imaginary unit, defined as `sqrt(-1)`
