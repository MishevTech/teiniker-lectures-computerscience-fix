# Configuration Management in C

In addition to the constructs of the programming language itself, it is also important to understand the different 
techniques of configuration management:

* [Debugging](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/debugging)
* Source Code Versioning
* [Build Automation](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/building)
* [Test Automation](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/testing)
        
As a development environment, you can use a pre-configured Linux VM image 
(Debian 10) as a [Virtual Lab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AzsF4Mvh1HJ8k6OW5W5hQ5CF0HdqA51l).
