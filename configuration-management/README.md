# Configuration Management in C

Configuration management refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant to a project, and the relationships between them, are stored, retrieved, uniquely identified, and modified.

We select the following topics from a wide range of configuration management techniques:

* [Source Code Versioning](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/c-basics/configuration-management/versioning) 

* [Build Automation](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/building)

* [Test Automation](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/testing)
