# Configuration Management in C

Configuration management refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant to a project, and the relationships between them, are stored, retrieved, uniquely identified, and modified.

We select the following topics from a wide range of configuration management techniques:

* [Build Automation](building)
   * [From C Source Code to an Executable](building/c-build-steps)
   * [C Preprocessor](../programming-c/c-advanced/preprocessor)
   * [Modular Programming](../programming-c/c-advanced/modules)
   * [C Libraries](building/string-operations-lib-static)

* [Test Automation](testing)

* [Source Code Versioning](versioning)
