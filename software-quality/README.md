# Software Quality

In the context of software engineering, software quality refers to two related but distinct notions:
* Software **functional quality** reflects how well it conforms to a given design, 
   based on functional requirements or specifications. 
* Software **structural quality** refers to how it meets extra-functional requirements that support 
   the delivery of the functional requirements, such as robustness or maintainability. 

In the context of C programming, we deal with the following techniques to increase our software quality:
