# Queue (First In, First Out)

The distinguishing character of a queue is that it stores and retrives data in a 
first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.

**The first element placed in the queue is the first to be removed**.

A convenient way to think of a queue is as a line at the post office.

Mainly the following basic operations are performed in the queue:
* **enqueue**: Place an element at the tail of a queue. 

* **dequeue**: Remove an element from the head of a queue. 

* **peek**: Inspect the element at the head of a queue without removing it.
