# Linux Command Line

## The Bourne Shell

A **shell** is a program that runs commands which the user enter.

The shell also serves as a small **programming environment**.
Many important parts of the system are **shell scripts** - text files that contain a sequence of shell commands.

There are many different Unix shells, but all derive several of their fetures from the **Bourne shell** 
in order to function correctly.
Linux uses an enhanced version of the Bourne shell called **bash** or the **Bourne-again shell**.
The bash shell is the default shell on most Linux distributions.
