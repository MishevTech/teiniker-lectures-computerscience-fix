# Stack (Last In, First Out)

The characteristic of a stack it that it stores and retrieves data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.

**The last element placed on the stack is the first to be removed**.

Mainly the following basic operations are performed in the stack:

* **push**: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
* **pop**: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
* **top**: Returns top element of stack.
* **is_empty**: Returns true if stack is empty, else false.
